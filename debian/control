Description: An XML document management system
 The XC is a framework for working with and managing XML documents
 over the web. The wep application is built with Django and provides a
 set of basic file operations remotely. The XML documents in turn can
 be used to define the web pages to disply. Optionally, Git can be
 used to track document changes.
